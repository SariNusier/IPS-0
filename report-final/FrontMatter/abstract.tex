This report will examine different approaches to indoor positioning and outline an implementation of machine learning algorithms to locate Wi-Fi enabled devices in an indoor environment. Moreover, it will combine the positioning solution with an orienteering solution to create and indoor guidance system that can be used in multiple applications, such as a digital museum guide.
